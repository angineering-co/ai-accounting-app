General
- Always `npm run lint` to fix all the issues after you make changes
- DO NOT auto git-add or git-commit the changes for me unless specifically asked

Frontend
- UI Components: Use shadcn library. Only build custom components if necessary
- Use modal component (e.g. dialog) + react-hook-form (i.e. https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form) to get user input
- Use toast component (e.g. sonner) to show API response to the user
- UI Styles: Reference the existing UI/UX patterns in the code base to build new flows
- Use swr library to fetch data with cache and deduping
- Call server actions to update data with validation
- Use zh-TW to display texts in UI

Backend
- Build server actions for reusability; export API route for client calls
- Refer to /docs/TECH_DESIGN.md for overall tech design decisions
